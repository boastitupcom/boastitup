# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OKR template display functionality is currently not working on the create OKR page despite having valid template data in the database. Users cannot see available OKR templates when trying to create new objectives, which blocks the core workflow of the OKR management system. This feature needs to be diagnosed and fixed to restore the template suggestion functionality that helps users create contextually relevant OKRs based on their brand's industry.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want to see relevant OKR templates when creating new objectives, so that I can quickly select and customize proven OKR frameworks for my industry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the create OKR page THEN the system SHALL display available OKR templates from the okr_master table
2. WHEN templates are loaded THEN the system SHALL filter templates based on my brand's industry context
3. WHEN no templates are available THEN the system SHALL display a clear empty state message
4. WHEN template loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option
5. WHEN templates load successfully THEN each template SHALL display title, description, category, and priority level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want the template loading to be fast and reliable, so that I can efficiently browse and select appropriate OKR templates without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the create OKR page loads THEN template data SHALL be fetched within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. WHEN templates are loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loading states
4. WHEN brand context is available THEN templates SHALL be pre-filtered by industry
5. WHEN multiple templates exist THEN they SHALL be sorted by priority level and category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error logging and debugging information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve template display issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN template fetching fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to console
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL log response status and data structure
3. WHEN brand context is missing THEN the system SHALL log warning and fallback behavior
4. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL log query parameters and results
5. WHEN component rendering fails THEN the system SHALL capture and log React error boundaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want to see templates organized by category and industry relevance, so that I can quickly find the most appropriate OKR templates for my specific business context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are displayed THEN they SHALL be grouped by category (Growth, Engagement, Revenue, etc.)
2. WHEN my brand has an industry set THEN templates SHALL prioritize matching industry templates
3. WHEN filtering by category THEN only relevant templates SHALL be visible
4. WHEN searching templates THEN results SHALL match title, description, or category
5. WHEN no filters match THEN the system SHALL show all available templates with clear messaging
