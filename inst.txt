Initial Request:
The user requested the implementation of a primary OKR (Objectives and Key Results) dashboard for a Social Media Analytics platform. The initial specifications were provided in an inst.txt file and included creating Supabase database tables, backend API functions, React hooks, and UI components.

Implementation Phase 1: Full Dashboard Build
The AI assistant built the complete dashboard, including:

Types & Interfaces: Defined all necessary data structures (OKRObjective, KPIScorecard, etc.).

Custom Hooks: Created useOKRSnapshot, useKPIScoreCards, and useDashboardFilters for data management.

UI Components: Built OKRSnapshotCard, KPIScoreCardGrid, and a details modal.

API Routes: Set up endpoints to fetch data.

Debugging Phase 1: Module Not Found Errors
The initial build failed due to incorrect relative import paths for the UI components (../../../ instead of ../../../../). This was quickly identified and fixed by adjusting the path depth.

Debugging Phase 2: Database Errors
The application then failed with errors indicating that the database views (mv_okr_performance and view_kpi_scorecards) did not exist.

Refined Requirements & Re-Implementation:
The user clarified that mv_okr_performance did exist but used brand_id and tenant_id for filtering, not organizationId. The user also requested to remove the KPI scorecards feature for the time being. The AI rebuilt the data flow accordingly:

The useOKRSnapshot hook and the OKR API route were updated to query the mv_okr_performance view using brand_id and tenant_id.

The dashboard page was updated to pull these IDs from the brandStore.

All KPI-related code was removed.

Debugging Phase 3: SQL Column Mismatch
A new error, "column mv_okr_performance.change_value does not exist," indicated a mismatch between the columns expected by the code and the actual database view schema.

Final Correction with Provided SQL Schema:
The user provided the exact SQL definition for the mv_okr_performance materialized view. The AI performed a final, major correction:

Corrected Column Mapping: The code was updated to select and use the actual columns from the view (e.g., objective_id, progress_percentage, variance) and removed references to non-existent ones.

Leveraged View Logic: Redundant front-end calculations for status, progress, and days remaining were removed, as the SQL view already handled this logic.

Updated Data Transformation: The logic was adjusted to map the view's data structure to the OKRSnapshot type used by the UI components.

UI/UX Improvement Phase:
The user noted that the UI, specifically the four main OKR cards, lacked visual distinction, using similar icons and colors.

First UI Refinement: The AI introduced distinct color schemes based on the metric type (revenue, customers, conversions) and updated some icons.

Second UI Refinement: After feedback that the cards were still too similar, a more specific fix was implemented. Each of the four main metrics was given a completely unique color theme and a more semantically relevant icon:

Monthly Revenue: Emerald Green theme with a DollarSign icon 💰.

New Customer Acquisition: Vibrant Blue theme with a UserPlus icon 👥+.

Average Order Value: Warm Orange theme with a CreditCard icon 💳.

Repeat Purchase Rate: Deep Purple theme with a Repeat icon 🔄.

The component's logic was updated to use these metric-specific styles, ensuring the final dashboard was visually distinct and easy to read at a glance, fully aligning with all user specifications.

vTech Story: OKR Real-Time Dashboard
📌 Feature Name OKR Real-Time Dashboard for Growth Tracking
🎯 Introduction The OKR Dashboard provides comprehensive real-time visibility into Objectives and Key Results performance across all business units. It enables marketing teams, executives, and growth managers to monitor progress toward critical goals like growing TikTok followers from 15K to 100K, improving engagement rates, and tracking revenue metrics. The dashboard transforms raw performance data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations, health scoring, and automated alerts for at-risk objectives.
❗ Problem Statement `Marketing and growth teams currently struggle with fragmented OKR tracking across multiple platforms and manual reporting processes. Key pain points include:
Data Silos: Metrics scattered across TikTok, Instagram, Google Analytics, and internal systems
Manual Reporting: Weekly/monthly manual compilation of progress updates consuming 4-6 hours per week
Delayed Insights: Performance issues identified too late, missing critical intervention windows
Executive Visibility: Leadership lacks real-time visibility into progress toward strategic objectives
Resource Allocation: Teams can't quickly identify which OKRs need immediate attention or additional resources
Historical Context: No easy way to analyze trends and predict future performance based on current trajectory`
✅ Solution Overview `The OKR Dashboard creates a unified, real-time command center for all objective tracking. The solution automatically aggregates data from multiple sources, calculates progress percentages, assigns health scores, and provides predictive insights. Key architectural principles include:
Real-time Data Processing: Live updates from fact_metric_value table through optimized database views
Modular Component System: Reusable React components built with shadcn/ui for consistency and maintainability
Intelligent Automation: Automated health scoring, performance status calculations, and at-risk identification
Decision Support: Interactive filtering, trend analysis, and drill-down capabilities for actionable insights`
🛠️ Technical Architecture
1. Data Layer
Entity
Description
v_okr_current_performance
Core view providing real-time OKR metrics with calculated progress percentages and performance status
v_okr_progress_summary
Aggregated view showing OKR health scores, metric counts, and completion statistics
v_brand_okr_dashboard
Executive summary view with brand-level performance distribution and category breakdowns
v_okr_trend_analysis
Historical performance data for trend visualization and predictive analytics
fact_metric_value
Source table containing all metric measurements from various platforms (TikTok, Instagram, etc.)









Best Practice: Centralize filtering and complex logic using views or stored procedures for performance and security.
2. API Layer
Use @supabase/supabase-js for database connectivity and real-time subscriptions.
Fetch from views using .from('v_okr_current_performance').select(...) for optimized queries.
Implement service classes (OKRService) to abstract database operations.
Utilize TanStack Query for intelligent caching with 2-5 minute stale times based on data volatility.
Best Practice: Abstract API logic into service modules or reusable hooks for testability and separation of concerns.
2.1. OKRService (Supabase Queries)
Purpose: Handles all data interactions with the Supabase public views.

// services/okrService.js
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabaseClient';

const BRAND_ID = '4743e593-3f09-4eba-96b4-c4c1413bca47'; // Use a constant or pass dynamically

export const OKRService = {
  // 1. Get all OKRs for FitLeasure brand with current performance
  fetchCurrentPerformanceOKRs: async (brandId = BRAND_ID) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('v_okr_current_performance')
      .select('*')
      .eq('brand_id', brandId)
      .order('is_primary', { ascending: false })
      .order('okr_category');
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  },

  // 2. Get OKR progress summary for executive review

      .eq('brand_id', brandId); // Add more filters if specific OKR or metric insights are needed
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  },
};

2.2. useOKRData (React Query Hook)
Purpose: Manages data fetching, caching, and synchronization for OKRs using React Query.
AC:
A primary useOKRData(brandId: string) hook (or multiple specialized hooks like useCurrentPerformance(brandId), useProgressSummary(brandId), etc.) that wraps OKRService calls.
Utilizes React Query's useQuery to manage loading, error, and data states for each view.
Caches fetched data to prevent unnecessary re-fetches.
Automatically refetches data on stale queries (e.g., on window focus, or configurable intervals).
Ensures brandId is passed down to OKRService calls.
// hooks/useOKRData.js
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { OKRService } from '../services/okrService';

const STALE_TIME_MINUTES = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes in milliseconds

export const useCurrentPerformanceOKRs = (brandId) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['okrsCurrentPerformance', brandId],
    queryFn: () => OKRService.fetchCurrentPerformanceOKRs(brandId),
    staleTime: STALE_TIME_MINUTES,
    enabled: !!brandId, // Only run query if brandId is available
  });
};

export const useProgressSummary = (brandId) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['okrProgressSummary', brandId],
    queryFn: () => OKRService.fetchProgressSummary(brandId),
    staleTime: STALE_TIME_MINUTES,
    enabled: !!brandId,
  });
};

export const useBrandDashboardOverview = (brandId) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['brandDashboardOverview', brandId],
    queryFn: () => OKRService.fetchBrandDashboardOverview(brandId),
    staleTime: STALE_TIME_MINUTES,
    enabled: !!brandId,
  });
};

export const useOKRTrendAnalysis = (okrId) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['okrTrendAnalysis', okrId],
    queryFn: () => OKRService.fetchOKRTrendAnalysis(okrId),
    staleTime: STALE_TIME_MINUTES,
    enabled: !!okrId, // Only run if okrId is available
  });
};

export const useAttentionMetrics = (brandId) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['attentionMetrics', brandId],
    queryFn: () => OKRService.fetchAttentionMetrics(brandId),
    staleTime: STALE_TIME_MINUTES,
    enabled: !!brandId,
  });
};

export const useAIInsights = (brandId) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['aiInsights', brandId],
    queryFn: () => OKRService.fetchAIInsights(brandId),
    staleTime: STALE_TIME_MINUTES,
    enabled: !!brandId,
  });
};

2.3. Zustand Store (Application State)
Purpose: Maintains global application state (e.g., active tab, filter selections).
AC:
Stores activeTab, filterCategory, filterStatus.
Provides actions to update these state variables.
Components subscribe to relevant parts of the store for UI updates.
Here's the updated technical implementation story for the Next.js developer, incorporating the specific Supabase view names and queries.

// store/appStore.js
import { create } from 'zustand';

export const useAppStore = create((set) => ({
  activeTab: 'Overview',
  filterCategory: 'All',
  filterStatus: 'All',
  setTab: (tab) => set({ activeTab: tab }),
  setFilterCategory: (category) => set({ filterCategory: category }),
  setFilterStatus: (status) => set({ filterStatus: status }),
}));
2.4. Progress and Health Calculations
These calculations will be done on the frontend using the data fetched from v_okr_current_performance. This function should be a pure utility.
// utils/okrCalculations.js
export const calculateOKRStatus = (okr) => {
  const { current_value, metric_target_value, time_progress_percent, performance_status: initialStatus } = okr;

  if (initialStatus === "Target Achieved" || initialStatus === "Completed") { // Assuming 'Completed' is equivalent to 'Target Achieved' in views
    return {
      progress_percentage: 100,
      status: "Target Achieved",
      health: "green" // Assuming green for achieved
    };
  }
  if (initialStatus === "Not Started") {
    return {
      progress_percentage: 0,
      status: "Not Started",
      health: "gray"
    };
  }

  const progress_percentage = metric_target_value !== 0 ? (current_value / metric_target_value) * 100 : 0;
  let status = initialStatus; // Default to status from DB view
  let health = "gray";

  // Refine health based on progress and time_progress_percent (if available)
  if (progress_percentage >= 80) { // High progress
    health = "green";
  } else if (progress_percentage >= 50 && progress_percentage < 80) { // Medium progress
    health = "yellow";
  } else { // Low progress
    health = "red";
  }

  // Override health based on performance_status from DB for "At Risk" or "Behind"
  if (initialStatus === "At Risk") health = "red";
  if (initialStatus === "Behind") health = "yellow";

  return {
    progress_percentage: parseFloat(progress_percentage.toFixed(2)),
    status,
    health
  };
};

OKR Dashboard: Technical Implementation Story V2 🚀
This story outlines the development of the FitLeasure.com OKR Dashboard in Next.js, leveraging React components, state management with Zustand, data fetching with React Query, and real-time data from specified Supabase views.

1. Core UI Components (Built with shadcn/ui principles)
Developer will create reusable UI components focusing on responsiveness and accessibility. The components detailed in the previous story (e.g., ProgressRing, OKRHealthBadge, OKRCard, MetricsTable, DashboardStats, OKRTrendChart) remain the same in their rendering responsibilities. Their data input will now come from the updated data layer.

2. Data Layer & Real-time Tracking
Developer will set up the data flow, ensuring real-time updates and efficient state management using the specified Supabase views.
2.1. OKRService (Supabase Queries)
Purpose: Handles all data interactions with the Supabase public views.
AC:
fetchCurrentPerformanceOKRs(brandId: string): Fetches data from public.v_okr_current_performance for a given brand_id, ordered by is_primary DESC, okr_category.
fetchProgressSummary(brandId: string): Fetches data from public.v_okr_progress_summary for a given brand_id, ordered by okr_health_score DESC.
fetchBrandDashboardOverview(brandId: string): Fetches data from public.v_brand_okr_dashboard for a given brand_id.
fetchOKRTrendAnalysis(okrId: string): Fetches data from public.v_okr_trend_analysis for a given okr_id, where is_primary = true, ordered by date DESC.
fetchAttentionMetrics(brandId: string): Fetches metrics needing attention from public.v_okr_current_performance where brand_id matches and performance_status is 'Behind' or 'At Risk', is_primary = true, ordered by progress_percentage ASC.
fetchAIInsights(brandId: string): Fetches insights from public.ai_insights related to the brand_id (and potentially okr_objective_id or metric_type_id if specific insights are needed).
TC:
Unit test each fetch method with valid and invalid brandId/okrId inputs to ensure correct data retrieval or error handling.
Verify the structure of the returned data matches the expected schema from each view.
Simulate Supabase connection issues and verify robust error logging/handling.
2.2. useOKRData (React Query Hook)
Purpose: Manages data fetching, caching, and synchronization for OKRs using React Query.
AC:
A primary useOKRData(brandId: string) hook (or multiple specialized hooks like useCurrentPerformance(brandId), useProgressSummary(brandId), etc.) that wraps OKRService calls.
Utilizes React Query's useQuery to manage loading, error, and data states for each view.
Caches fetched data to prevent unnecessary re-fetches.
Automatically refetches data on stale queries (e.g., on window focus, or configurable intervals).
Ensures brandId is passed down to OKRService calls.
TC:
Test loading state: Components depending on the hook display loading indicators.
Test success state: Data from respective Supabase views is correctly fetched and available to components.
Test error state: Hook provides error information, and components handle errors gracefully.
Verify caching behavior: Data should not be re-fetched immediately on re-render if cached.
Verify refetch on external changes (e.g., by manually invalidating queries).
2.3. Zustand Store (Application State)
Purpose: Maintains global application state (e.g., active tab, filter selections).
AC:
Stores activeTab, filterCategory, filterStatus.
Provides actions to update these state variables.
Components subscribe to relevant parts of the store for UI updates.
TC:
Test tab switching: Verify activeTab updates correctly.
Test filter changes: Verify filterCategory and filterStatus update.
Ensure components re-render correctly when store state changes.
2.4. Progress and Health Calculations
Purpose: Automatic calculation of progress and health status for each OKR.
AC:
The calculateOKRStatus helper function will continue to derive progress_percentage, status, and health based on the data retrieved from the Supabase views (specifically v_okr_current_performance).
The calculations for current_value / target_value * 100 for progress and the comparative logic for health will be applied to the data fetched.



3. Frontend Layer

3.1. Tab Navigation
Purpose: Allows users to switch between different dashboard views.
AC:
Tabs for "Overview", "OKRs", "Metrics", "Attention", "AI Insights".
Clicking a tab updates the activeTab state and displays the corresponding content, populated by data from the appropriate views.
4. AI Insights Section
Developer will implement the AI Insights display, fetching real insights from the ai_insights table.
